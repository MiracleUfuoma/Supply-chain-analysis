# Supply-chain-analysis
This project showcases a comprehensive supply chain analysis using SQL, designed to provide actionable insights for a beauty and cosmetics startup. The analysis covers key areas such as sales performance, inventory optimization, supplier performance, shipping efficiency, and customer insights.
# Objective
The primary goal of this project is to conduct an extensive analysis of supply chain data, focusing on extracting key insights and identifying opportunities for improvement. Although this initiative is primarily for practice purposes, it aims to explore various components of the supply chain, ranging from operational efficiency to cost management. The objective is to develop a deeper understanding of these processes and propose potential strategic improvements.
This analysis utilises a dataset sourced from Kaggle, kindly provided by Amir Motefaker, available here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amirmotefaker/supply-chain-dataset.
# Project Context & Scope: 
This analysis was developed as a hands-on learning project to demonstrate technical SQL proficiency. While the data variables may reflect a high level of complexity, the conclusions are based strictly on the data provided and the defined scope of this EDA. My focus is on the rigor of the analysis and the practical application of advanced SQL techniques, rather than providing definitive strategic advice on professional supply chain management.
# Data Collection and Analysis Steps
## Data Import and Preliminary Inspection:
* Import the supply chain dataset in CSV format and perform an initial review to understand its structure and content.
